## Velocity

Great!!! you are one step away from completing your Unity Physics course ðŸ˜Ž
Welcome to the final chapter of Unity Physics!!!! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

We know that velocity is the rate of change of an objectâ€™s position. In Unity, when you add rigidbody to a game object and apply velocity, it works the exact same way as that of its definition. It represents the rate of change of Rigidbody position.

        public Rigidbody2D rb;

        void Start()
        {
            rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
        }

        voidFixedUpdate()
        {
                rb.velocity = newVector2(0, 5);
        }
