## Raycasts

- Try guessing what a Raycast is 😉 
- A Raycast is like a laser beam fired from a point that we call as “Origin” along a particular direction to detect if our game object is still in collision with the other game object and if it is not in collision we perform certain operations.

- The big advantage is that every object which makes contact with the laser beam can be reported/detected.

    ``` cs
        public class Patrolling_Enemies : MonoBehaviour
        {
            public Transform originpoint; 
            Vector2 dir = new Vector2(-1, 0); 
            public float range; 
            public float speed;
            Rigidbody2D rb;

            void Start()
            {
                rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody2D>();
            }
            
            void Update()
            {
                RaycastHit2D hit = Physics2D.Raycast(originpoint.position, dir, range); 
                if(hit == false)
                {
                    Vector3 new_Scale = transform.localScale; 
                    new_Scale.x *= -1; 
                    transform.localscale = new_Scale; 
                    speed *= -1; 
                    dir *= -1;
                }
            }         
    ```
    
- In the above code, RaycastHit2D returns information about an object detected by a raycast in 2D physics. The RaycastHit2D class is used by [Physics2D.Raycast](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Physics2D.Raycast.html) and other functions to return information about the objects detected within the range fired by raycasts. 👾
